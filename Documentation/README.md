- KawasakiEr6n2007NtcTheoreticalCurve.png: theoretical curve of the NTC IAT sensor installed on a Kawasaki ER-6n (ER-6f) 2007 engine I found by chance on the internet when trying to "interpolate" information found on the Service Manual with some comments I found on various italian and american forums.
- KawasakiEr6n2007NtcMeasurements.xlsx: practical measurements of the same NTC IAT sensor probe I purchased from eBay for the purpose; NTC resistance was measured through Tektronix TX3 multimeter while temperature through PicoLog TC-08 Data Logger, which is just a little bit oversized for the purpose, but... it was what I already had in the lab).
